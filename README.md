# News-Scraper-App
A web app that scrapes articles from a news site and lets you save the article and your comments to a Mongo database. 



The News Scraper app is a full stack web app that enables users to scrape the latest headlines from a prominent news media site and store them in a Mongo database. This app also allows users to create, edit or delete comments about the stored articles. 

##Setup Instructions: 

This application uses several JavaScript npm packages to interact with the JavaScript runtime environment.

To install these npm packages: Open your Command Prompt terminal and navigate to your cloned project folder. Run the 'npm install' command to add the required npm packages.

Make a .gitignore file and add the following lines to it. This will tell git not to track these files, and thus they won't be committed to Github.

node modules

This application uses a Mongo database. 

If you plan to deploy a version of this application, you will need to provision a Mongo database immediately after you deploy it. This install uses Heroku as the hosting web server and mLab as the Mongo database provider. 

This project is useful because it gives the developer experience with using a Mongo database, setting up full stack file structures, exporting/requiring modules, defining server html/api routes, using jquery and ajax, and using the Mongoose ORMs to perform all of the interactions with the Mongo database. 

Currently, only the original developer maintains and contributes to this project.
